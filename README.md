# Serious Cards for Home Assistant
A set of background function cards. The first card I made triggers an action after a view has been
shown for a given time. Also contains a card that breaks sideways scrolling. More features and cards
will come.

## Cards
### sc-timed-action
This is a hidden card that triggers an action after a given timout has passed. This can for instance
be used to show a secondary view for a limited time, before going back to the main view. This can be
very usefull for wall-mounted control panels, where you want to prevent the need of pressing a back
button. It also has some limited 'call-service' posibilities, so you could run a script, or toggle
some lights.

### sc-scroll-breaker
This is a hidden card that prevents sideways scrolling. Can be handy to keep a panel in view if an
other cards container gets to wide for some reason (like style modding).
