# Serious Cards for Home Assistant
A set of background function cards. The first card I made triggers an action after a view has been shown for a given time. Also
contains a card that breaks sideways scrolling. More features and cards will come.

## sc-timed-action
This is a hidden card that triggers an action after a given timout has passed. This can for instance be used to show a secondary view
for a limited time, before going back to the main view. This can be very usefull for wall-mounted control panels, where you want to
prevent the need of pressing a back button.
